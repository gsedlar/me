Task:  Revisiting a problem from HW2, let's recreate our team builder using pandas. Our menu 
should have four options: 
    a. Add To Team 
    b. Drop From Team 
    c. Print Team 
    d. Exit 

Similar to last week, a team can only have six members of the team. If you attempt to 
add more than that, you should return the message "Too many team members". The 
pokemon also needs to exist within our dataset. If it does not, you should return the 
message "This pokemon does not exist". If it does, you can add it to your team. 

Using the solution from last week, you can manage the team in the same way. If a user 
wants to drop a member from the team â€“ they should be able to provide some identifier 
that you indicate to drop them from the team. 

If choosing to print the team,you should return a DataFrame showing rows for each of 
the current members of the team. 

After each option, the user should be returned to the main menu until they decide to exit.
