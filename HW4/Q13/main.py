Task:   Let's work on managing our dataset. Write an application that gives the user the 
following options: 
    a. Manage Dataset 
    b. Exit 

If the user chooses to Exit, write the poke dataset (with changes) to a file called q13.out 

If the user choose Manage Dataset, provide three additional options:
    - Add Pokemon
    - Delete Pokemon 
    - Update Pokemon 

The last two (Delete and Update) should prompt you for an ID. For delete, it should remove that 
pokemon from the dataset. For update, it should prompt you to update the pokemon name. 

For add, you should create a new record utilizing the existing columns of our dataset and 
prompt the user to provide values for each of them. Once the values are set, it should then add 
this new record to the existing dataset. 

After each action, you should be returned to the main menu, where the user can then decide to 
take similar actions or exit. As before, when the user exits â€“ the dataframe (with whatever 
updates have been made) should be written to a file called q13.out
