Task: Like we have in past weeks â€“ build an application that allows a user to build a team of 
pokemon. This team can consist of a maximum of 6 pokemon. A user should be able to provide 
up to 6 pokemon names and they must exist within the pokemon dataset. Your menu should 
provide for the following options:
    - Add pokemon 
    - Generate random team 
    - Delete Pokemon 
    - Exit 

When a user decides to exit, draw a graph showing the base_experience for each member 
still existing in the team.
