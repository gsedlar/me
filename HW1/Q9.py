Task: Building from q8, letâ€™s provide a menu to continue managing this team. We should have 
the following options: 
    1) Add Pokemon 
    2) List Team 
    3) Drop Member 
    4) Exit 
Your application should do and store everything just as we do in q8. However now if a user 
chooses option 2, you should output a list of just the pokemon names on the team alongside an 
ID that can be referred to for their position in the team. An example output would look like: 
    1) Pikachu 
    2) Bulbasaur 
    3) Charmander 
If the user chooses option 3, they should be prompted for an ID of the member that they want to 
remove from the team. Once provided, you should then drop that member from the team.
