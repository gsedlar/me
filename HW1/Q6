Task: Create a python application that reads from the attached file called poke.csv. Your 
application should prompt the user for the name of a pokemon. The user should be able 
to provide the name of a pokemon in any case and if there is a match within that file it 
should print both the ID and the name of the pokemon to a file called q6.out. If the 
name of the pokemon doesn’t exist, nothing should be printed to the file but a message 
should be printed to the user alerting them that the pokemon doesn’t exist.
